Arnel Pedrosa.','The parking fee presently collected by the Puerto Princesa Baywalk Management Board is mandated by an ordinance, according to city administrator Atty. Arnel Pedrosa.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe recent implementation of the parking fee collection by the baywalk management has sparked a variety of responses from netizens, who are divided in their opinions due to the area being considered a public space.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPedrosa, however, explained that the baywalk management is authorized to collect parking fees for different types of vehicles under City Ordinance No. 794, or the Revised Revenue Code of 2016.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n“Doon [sa ordinance] ay may section doon (Section 13 D.03 Item No. 7) na nakalagay kung magkano yung parking fees dyan sa baywalk at yan din ang ini-implement ng ating baywalk management board,” Pedrosa told the media in an interview on Monday.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHowever, he stated that there should have been a public consultation beforehand. Nevertheless, since there is a provision in the ordinance, it is already considered effective.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n“Unless sabihin ng Sanggunian na i-defer muna pansamantala yung implementation or enforcement nyan. Siguro if they can come up with an amendment to that ordinance for that purpose or to that effect ay saka pa lamang pwedeng i-suspend ang implementation,” he explained.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n“Siyempre nga naman magbabayad ka, although mailiit naman yung amount. Pero para sa iba, maliit o malaki, ang tingin nila, public place kasi yan so nakikita nila na parang agrabyado sila. Pero sabi nga rin, nakabili ka nga ng kotse or motor, ang presumption ay may pambayad ka rin ng parking fee,” he added.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPedrosa also emphasized the need to assign a parking attendant in the area to ensure the safety and security of the vehicles.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFurthermore, he mentioned that despite the ordinance being in effect since 2016, the implementation of the parking fee only took place this year after the internal affairs service discovered that the baywalk, as one of the city government’s economic enterprises, had no revenue collection from it.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPedrosa also mentioned his intention to consult with the baywalk management and evaluate their suggestions before submitting his own recommendations to the Sangguniang Panlungsod.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMeanwhile, Vice Mayor Ma. Nancy Socrates expressed that the collection of parking fees presents a challenging balancing act for the city government.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n“Mahirap balansehin dahil on one hand, siyempre kailangan din ng city government ng extra income and on the other hand, parang kawawa rin yung ibang tao na magjo-jogging lang, magbabayad pa,” Socrates said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n“I think hindi na-consult ang city council pero ang dapat talaga i-consult ay ang communit. Although siyempre ang pamahalaan ang siyang nagbibigay ng guidelines and kasi kagaya niyan maraming nagrereklamo. Since matagal na yung ordinance and then ngayon lang na-implement, sana nagkaroon din ng consultation,” she added.\r\n','local2.jpg','Local',0),(6,'06-06-2023','09:54','LPA over Philippine Sea now Tropical Depression Chedeng','Gaea Katreena Cabico ','Philstar.com','author101.jpg','The tropical depression called Chedeng was the country’s third cyclone this year.','MANILA, Philippines — The low pressure area over the Philippine Sea developed into a tropical depression Tuesday, but the cyclone is not expected to bring heavy rain and strong winds in the next few days, state weather bureau PAGASA said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe tropical depression, called Chedeng, is the third cyclone to enter country this year.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIt was last spotted 1,170 kilometers east of southeastern Luzon, with peak winds of 45 km per hour near the center and gusts of up to 55 kph.

It is also not expected to cause rough sea conditions over the country’s coastal waters in the next 24 hours.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPAGASA said that while the current forecast scenario for Chedeng may enhance the southwest monsoon (habagat), the areas that will be affected, timing and intensity of monsoon rains and winds may still change.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe agency explained this is due to the “dependence of monsoon enhancement on forecast movement and intensity of Chedeng and its interaction with the other weather systems surrounding it.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nChedeng is forecast to intensify in the next four days and may be upgraded to tropical storm category by Wednesday.

each other and lines of bodies collected by rescue workers: as dawn broke on Saturday, it revealed the horror of one of Indias deadliest railway crashes.\n<br/><br/>\nInvolving two passenger trains and another carrying goods, the accident saw one train ram so hard into another that carriages were lifted high into the air, twisting and then smashing off the tracks.\n<br/><br/>\nAnother carriage had been tossed entirely onto its roof, crushing the passenger section.\n<br/><br/>\nOn the ground -- and squashed into the ripped metal wreckage and what were once benches in the carriage -- travellers belongings lay scattered: a suitcase, a childs shoe and piles of clothes.\n<br/><br/>\nAt least 288 people were killed and more than 850 injured in the crash on Friday night near Balasore, in the eastern state of Odisha, officials said, with many fearing the death toll could rise.\n<br/><br/>\nOvernight, images broadcast on local television stations showed long lines of bodies laid out with white sheets covering some, as rescue workers carried them away on stretchers.\n<br/><br/>\nTeams using metal cutting tools prised open gaps in the torn sides of carriages in a desperate search to reach those trapped inside, pulling out survivors and bodies.\n<br/><br/>\nRescue teams dressed in orange overalls and wearing face masks, including officers from Indias National Disaster Response Force, carried those they could extract to get aid.\n<br/><br/>\nThroughout the night, the death toll jumped repeatedly, as emergency services added up the number of bodies collected: from 50, to over 100, to nearly 300.\n<br/><br/>\nSudhanshu Sarangi, director general of Odisha Fire Services, speaking at the site to AFP, warned of \"serious injuries\".\n<br/><br/>\nThe near-constant sound of ambulance sirens wailed in the background, rushing those pulled out of the wreckage alive to hospital.\n<br/><br/>\nWith so many hurt, buses also carried the injured to medical centres.\n<br/><br/>\nFrom a distance, residents stood watching the efforts.\n<br/><br/>\nIn nearby hospitals, volunteers lined up to give blood, with medics overwhelmed by the scale of the need.\n<br/><br/>\nHuge crowds gathered at the entrance of Bhadrak District Hospital, standing in shock as ambulance after ambulance arrived.\n<br/><br/>\nDazed and bloodied passengers waited for help, as doctors rushed to stem the bleeding and support those most critically injured.\n','world2.jpg','World',0),(13,'06-06-2023','17:58','Experts warn bird flu virus changing rapidly in largest ever outbreak','Daniel Lawler','Philstar.com','author101.jpg','The virus causing record cases of avian influenza in birds across the world is changing rapidly, experts have warned, as calls increase for countries to vaccinate their poultry. ','PARIS, France — The virus causing record cases of avian influenza in birds across the world is changing rapidly, experts have warned, as calls increase for countries to vaccinate their poultry.\n<br/><br/> \nWhile emphasising that the risk to humans remains low, the experts who spoke to AFP said that the surging number of bird flu cases in mammals was a cause for concern.\n<br/><br/>\nSince first emerging in 1996, the H5N1 avian influenza virus had previously been confined to mostly seasonal outbreaks.\n<br/><br/>\nBut \"something happened\" in mid-2021 that made the group of viruses much more infectious, according to Richard Webby, the head of a World Health Organization collaborating centre studying influenza in animals.\n<br/><br/>\nSince then, outbreaks have lasted all year round, spreading to new areas and leading to mass deaths among wild birds and tens of millions of poultry being culled.\n<br/><br/>\nWebby, who is a researcher at St Jude Childrens Research Hospital in the US city of Memphis, told AFP it was \"absolutely\" the largest outbreak of avian influenza the world had seen.\n<br/><br/>\nHe led research, published this week in the journal Nature Communications, showing how the virus rapidly evolved as it spread from Europe into North America.\nThe study said the virus increased in virulence, which means it causes more dangerous disease, when in arrived in North America.\n<br/><br/>\nThe researchers also infected a ferret with one of the new strains of bird flu. \n<br/><br/>\nThe found an unexpectedly \"huge\" amount of the virus in its brain, Webby said, indicating it had caused more serious disease than previous strains. \n<br/><br/>\nEmphasising that the risk in humans was still low, he said that \"this virus is not being static, it is changing\".\n<br/><br/>\n\"That does increase the potential that even just by chance\" the virus could \"pick up genetic traits that allow it to be more of a human virus,\" he said.\nIn rare cases, humans have contracted the sometimes deadly virus, usually after coming in close contact with infected birds.\n\n','world3.jpg','World',0),(14,'05-20-2023','19:58','Plastic-eating fungi found in Chinese coastal salt marshes',NULL,NULL,NULL,'An international team of scientists identified plastic-eating

of scientists identified plastic-eating bacteria and fungi in Chinese coastal salt marshes, presenting new possibilities for global waste management, according to a study published Thursday.\n<br/><br/>\n\"A total of 184 fungal and 55 bacterial strains capable of breaking down\" various plastics were found in the Jiangsu province of eastern China, the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew said in a statement.\n<br/><br/> \nResearchers from China and the UK in May 2021 sampled microorganisms from Chinas Dafeng, a UNESCO-protected site near the coast of the Yellow Sea.\n<br/><br/>\nThey found a distinct \"terrestrial plastisphere\", described as a \"man-made ecological niche\", which is an ecosystem that has evolved to live with the presence of coastal plastic debris.\n<br/><br/>\n\"Scientists are increasingly looking at microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to help tackle some of the most pressing challenges of the modern age, including the rising tide of plastic pollution,\" Kew Gardens said.\n<br/><br/>\nThe new findings contribute to existing studies on plastic-degrading microorganisms with some 436 species of fungi and bacteria found capable of breaking down plastic to date, it added.\n<br/><br/>\n\"Kew scientists and partners believe their latest findings could lead to the development of efficient enzymes designed to biologically degrade plastic waste,\" it went on.\n<br/><br/>\nIn 2020, approximately 238 million metric tonnes of waste from short-lived plastics -- such as packaging that ends up in municipal waste -- was generated worldwide, according to a recent report from the United Nations Environment Programme.\n<br/><br/>\nRoughly half of that was mismanaged -- for example dumped in the environment or burned. \n<br/><br/>\nLater this month, representatives from nearly 200 countries will meet in Paris for a new round of negotiations aimed at reaching a legal agreement next year to end plastic pollution.\n\n','world4.jpg','World',0),(15,'07.06.2023.','09:02','Musk says China detailed plans to regulate AI','','','','Top Chinese officials told Elon Musk about plans to launch new regulations

Elon Musk about plans to launch new regulations on artificial intelligence on his recent trip to the Asian giant, the tech billionaire said Monday, in his first comments on the two-day visit.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Twitter owner and Tesla CEO — one of the worlds richest men — held meetings with senior officials in Beijing and employees in Shanghai last week.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\"Something that is worth noting is that on my recent trip to China, with the senior leadership there, we had, I think, some very productive discussions on artificial intelligence risks, and the need for some oversight or regulation,\" Musk said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\"And my understanding from those conversations is that China will be initiating AI regulation in China.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMusk, whose extensive interests in China have long raised eyebrows in Washington, spoke about the exchange in a livestreamed Twitter discussion with Democratic presidential hopeful and vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert Kennedy Jr, the nephew of John F. Kennedy.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMusk did not tweet while in China and Tesla has not released readouts of Musks meeting with officials.\r\nBut official Chinese channels said he lavished praise on the country, including for its \"vitality and promise,\" and expressed \"full confidence in the China market.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA flurry of Chinese companies have been rushing to develop AI services that can mimic human speech since San Francisco-based OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBut rapid advancements have stoked global alarm over the technology potential for disinformation and misuse.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMusk did not elaborate on his discussions in China but was likely referring to a sweeping draft law requiring new AI products to undergo a security assessment before release and a process ensuring that they reflect \"core socialist values.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe \"Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services\" edict bans content promoting \"terrorist or extremist propaganda,\" \"ethnic hatred\" or \"other content that may disrupt economic and social order.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nUnder Beijings highly centralized political system, the measures are almost certain to become law.\r\nMusk has caused controversy by suggesting the self-ruled island of Taiwan should become part of China — a stance that was welcomed by Chinese officials but which deeply angered Taipei.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe 51-year-old South African native described his meetings in China as \"very promising.\" \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\"I pointed out that if there is a digital super intelligence that is overwhelmingly powerful, developed in China, it is actually a risk to the sovereignty of the Chinese government,\" he said.\r\n\"And I think they took that concern to heart.\"\r\n','world5.jpg','World',0),(16,'07.06.2023.','09:11','Taylor Swift Reacts to Accidentally Swallowing a Bug During Chicago Show','Maria Czarlette Trixia G.

Now, an unforgettable encounter was making Swifties react adoringly.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWhile performing her “Evermore” set and about to start singing “Tolerate It,” fate interrupted her in an extraordinary way. A bug came in the way of her captivating performance at Chicagos Soldier Field.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe pop icon could not help but declare, “I just swallowed a bug!” Despite her efforts to shake it off and keep her composure, she could not hide the hilarious ordeal.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nShe said, “It is just so stupid.” In surprise, Taylor Swift shook her head while trying to spit out the insect.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA few moments after, she exclaimed, “Delicious!” Her candid remark initiated laughter among the audience, while others showed sympathy, a Billboard report confirmed.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nTaylor Swifts Humor in Times of Adversity\r\nThe bug instance was not the only mishap she faced that night.
